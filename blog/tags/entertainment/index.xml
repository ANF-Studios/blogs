            </div><p>As a gamer, I have to recommend a game. There are many games worth recommendation, and everyone has different preferred games style. However, there&rsquo;s one game I&rsquo;d recommend to anyone: Ultimate Chicken Horse.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really a reviewer, so I won&rsquo;t explain everything, but first things first&hellip;</p>]]></description>

            </div><p>I was putting this show off for a long time. I really disliked how hyped it is. For some reason I hated how everyone is talking about it.<br>
However, this summer I decided to catch up. I was fed up with spoilers all over the place - it was really hard to avoid them. Honestly, spoiling shows and films on purpose/without warning should be against the law, but unfortunately it isn&rsquo;t, so it was about time to watch this thing.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not good at reviews, so I might not talk about everything I should. Treat this post (and all other IMO posts) as just opinions and thoughts rather than a comprehensive review.</p>]]></description>
