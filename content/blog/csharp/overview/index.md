Oh hello there!

If you're here and this is your first time/series here, I would recommend taking a look at the first series where I introuced to programming and C#, we also got everything set up and ran our first hello world program. If you have gone through that, you don't really need to read it, but I'd still recommend that.

And if you are coming from that article, I hope you've done your "homework". If you got stuck, feel free to ask for help at my discord server: [discord/ANF-Studios](https://discord.gg/fKWpK7A) - there are a ton of programmers that have experience in programming so they should be really helpful.

Anyhow, let's get started!

## About C#
C# really helps out to create robust and durable applications. This is all thanks to Microsoft. Speaking of Microsoft, they are the ones who are developing C# based on dotNET, which is what we installed in the previous post.

Quick note this part is not really necessary to read but it's intersting information:

When Sun introduced Java in 1995, Microsoft saw the potential in the language and its ecosystem, and attempted to implement that strategy. It introduced its own implementation of the JVM with IE3, and then started enhancing it beyond the Java standard. Sun sued Microsoft in October 1997 for incompletely implementing the Java 1.1 standard, which forced Microsoft to eventually discontinue its implementation.

Rather than switching to Sunâ€™s JVM, and thus giving Sun significant leverage in the Windows world, Microsoft decided to "out Sun" Sun, by introducing their own language and platform, and effectively killing Java on Windows. They brought renowned programming languages designer Anders Hejlsberg on board, who already had experience mutating and improving existing programming languages, and gave him the task to create a "better Java" (not officially, but in practice). Thus C# and the .NET framework were born.
