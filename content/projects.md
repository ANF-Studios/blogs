Hey there!

These are the current projects that [@ANF Org](https://github.com/ANF) (managed by [@ANF-Studios](https://github.com/ANF-Studios)) is currently working on. They may either be open source or closed source. They contain:
* Project name

* **Current goals**:
    - Complete the C# and C++ series

* **Notes**:
    - Redesign the bot, in TypeScript.
    - Have minimal features but not bare minimum.
    - Dynamic code (unlike v1) which works according to the code and is not hard coded.

    - Make it a modern notepad application.
    - Make it highly customizable.
    - Bump it to a stable version.

## Obsidian Engine
* **Project name**: Obsidian
* **Description**: A game engine made by ANF.
* **Current goals**: 
    - Create an engine with which you can make a game even if not playable.
* **Notes**:
    - Get the bare bones to work.
    - Make the documentation.
    - Make/Get a logo for it, an original one.
    - Work on the readme file, and design it.
    - The game engine is currently closed source, make it open source sooner.

Of course, that does not mean that these will be my only projects. I might also work on side projects and share updates along! :slightly_smiling_face:

I also share updates frequently in my discord server, you can check that out as well at [Discord/ANF-Studios](https://discord.gg/fKWpK7A).
