Oh, hello there!
I think you're interested in learning C# (pronounced as C Sharp). Well, you're in luck because [ANF](https://github.com/ANF) is planning to make tutorials and write some tips on C#. For those of you who like to interact through video, no this series will most likely never be based on video. There shall be nothing but plain text to read. So I hope you like reading!

Before we get into this, I want to give you a quick disclaimer that I am no C# professional and I am only really just going to teach you everything that I know. I will try to make everything as detailed and as simple to understand as possibly. Quick note that if something is incorrect, you can hit me up at my Discord at [discord/ANF-Studios](https://discord.gg/fKWpK7A) (you can also get some help by other cool programmers there :wink:) or just create a PR at the repository; [github/ANF/anf.github.io](https://github.com/ANF/anf.github.io/pulls).

So let's get started, shall we?

Well, there might be a number of different people here with different reactions:

1. The beginner, who asks;
    - What is programming and what is its extent?

2. The novice
    - Time to write something that works.

3. The professional
    - Stand back, time to write a game engine, an operating system, make a computer and whatnot.

The beginner has the right thought.
