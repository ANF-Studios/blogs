    <description><![CDATA[<p>Publishing a DocFX page manually each time you change it is yet another tedious step that would need to be performed during release. Recently I was releasing v1.0.0 of my <a href="https://github.com/TehGM/Wolfringo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Wolfringo</a> library, and I set up automated publishing using GitHub Actions!</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>gRPC services are great - they&rsquo;re fast and lightweight. However, for many use cases, REST WebAPI is also desirable. This post explains how to run them both at once.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently I migrated this very blog from Wordpress to Hugo. It wasn&rsquo;t a hard task, nor it was a very long one - but still I encountered some challenges, so I decided to document that. Plus when a change like this happens, some explanation is needed anyway.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>I was never a blogging person, but since I put this blog up (for reasons described below), it may as well have at least one post.</p>
<p>Recently I bought a domain (<a href="http://tehgm.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">tehgm.net</a>). Since then, I was browsing internet for ideas what to do with it. Many people posted about perks of owning a domain - claiming your online presence, hosting a blog or URL shortener, to name a few. But I haven&rsquo;t seem many unique ideas.</p>
<p>This is where I realized that the fact of me browsing ideas is one benefit of owning a domain that most people don&rsquo;t talk about - it gives me a reason to do something.</p>]]></description>
