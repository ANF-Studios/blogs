# Current projects

## pastemyst-rs
- Cover all the required features and finally bump it to version 1.
- Possibly write a custom implementation of an http request or switch to one that doesn't send a Result<...>.

## BotANF
- Redesign the bot, in TypeScript.
- Have minimal features but not bare minimum.
- Dynamic code (unlike v1) which works according to the code and is not hard coded.

## Draft (formerly as ANFPad)
- Make it a modern notepad application.
- Make it highly customizable.
- Bump it to a stable version.

## Obsidian
- Get the bare bones to work.
- Make the documentation.
- Make/Get a logo for it, an original one.
- Work on the readme file, and design it.

Of course, that does not mean that these will be my only projects. I might also work on side projects and share updates along! :smile:
