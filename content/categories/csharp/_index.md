Hello there!

<div class="description">
    <h3>This is the C# series that ANF decided to work on!</h3>
    <p>They're not really perfect, but we'll try to keep them as detailed and simple (at the same time) as possible.</p>
</div>

{{<admonition type=note title="The architecture of our tutorials" >}}
I've decided that I would after "welcoming back", usually give some fun facts and information. After which we'll move on to the topic of the day and finally wrap up. You'll also get homework/assignment which you.. don't really have to do, but it's highly recommended for practice. Sadly, I won't be able to review your task (unless you're in my discord server where you can also get help if you get stuck. Join here: [Discord/ANF-Studios](https://discord.gg/fKWpK7A)).

Here is the entire index of this series, you can click on the text to open up that series:


{{<admonition tip "Easily find the tutorial where you left" false>}}
You can, if you're on pc, press Control + F and search the name/number of the series you last left off or have to continue on, and that's it! You'll be there in notime - this note is just here for when there are a lot of tutorials.
