Hello there, from the ANF team!

Welcome to the very first blog! This is where we will be writing about updates on new and current projects and tutorials. We are currently working on 4 projects, most open source and free to view and try out.

We are a small team of passionate developers trying to contribute to the open source community. [ANF](https://github.com/ANF) is the organization where [@ANF-Studios](https://github.com/ANF-Studios) has his main repositories, so you can check those out.. and hey, don't forget to click the follow button :wink:

## [BotANF](https://github.com/ANF/BotANF)
BotANF is the official Discord bot in the ANF Studios Discord server. Join the server by the way: [discord/ANF-Studios](https://discord.gg/fKWpK7A) :eyes:

## [PasteMystRS](https://github.com/ANF/pastemyst-rs)
PasteMystRS is a API wrapper for [PasteMyst](https://paste.myst.rs), written in the Rust programming language.

## Obsidian
It's a game engine, currently closed source but we're going to make it open source pretty soon, stay tuned for that - you don't want to miss it out.
