      <description>As a beginner, at some point or another, you must have encountered null reference exception while developing your application and it&amp;rsquo;s really hard to understand how to fix it (mainly because, in my opinion, some game devs do not have prior knowledge of C#). So today, you&amp;rsquo;ll be learning how to fix it, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to simplify it as much as possible. So first of all, I want to start off with null reference exceptions because well, it&amp;rsquo;s a really common programming mistake and commonly repeated especially by beginners, so I am going to guide you through about what this &amp;ldquo;Null Reference Exception&amp;rdquo; is and how to fix it.</description>
