Oh hello there!

If you're here and this is your first time/series here, I would recommend taking a look at the first series where I introuced to programming and C#, we also got everything set up and ran our first hello world program. If you have gone through that, you don't really need to read it, but I'd still recommend that.

And if you are coming from that article, I hope you've done your "homework". If you got stuck, feel free to ask for help at my discord server: [discord/ANF-Studios](https://discord.gg/fKWpK7A) - there are a ton of programmers that have experience in programming so they should be really helpful.

Anyhow, let's get started!
