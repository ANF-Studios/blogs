Oh, hello there!
I think you're interested in learning C# (pronounced as "See Sharp"). Well, you're in luck because [ANF](https://github.com/ANF) is planning to make tutorials and write some tips on C#. For those of you who like to interact through video, no this series will most likely never be based on video. There shall be nothing but plain text to read. So I hope you like reading!

Before we get into this, I want to give you a quick disclaimer that I am no C# professional and I am only really just going to teach you everything that I know. I will try to make everything as detailed and as simple to understand as possibly. Quick note that if something is incorrect, you can hit me up at my Discord at [discord/ANF-Studios](https://discord.gg/fKWpK7A) (you can also get some help by other cool programmers there :wink:) or just create a PR at the repository; [github/ANF/anf.github.io](https://github.com/ANF/anf.github.io/pulls).

So let's get started, shall we?

Well, there might be a number of different people here with different reactions:

1. The beginner, who asks;
    - What is programming and what is its extent?

2. The novice, who says;
    - Time to write something that works.

3. The professional, who says;
    - Stand back, time to write a game engine, an operating system, make a computer and whatnot.

The beginner has the right thought. So let's first get to know about programming itself, to know what we're dealing with. I'm going to give you a few seconds to think it out yourself. Ask yourself, "what is programming?". It's okay if you can't define it, just tell yourself whatever you know. Now let's compare it with the actual definition according to wikipedia:
> Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task.

Automation, to make our lives easier
