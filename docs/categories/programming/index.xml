      <description>Introduction Oh, hello there! I think you&amp;rsquo;re interested in learning C# (pronounced as &amp;ldquo;See Sharp&amp;rdquo;). Well, you&amp;rsquo;re in luck because ANF is planning to make tutorials and write some tips on C#. For those of you who like to interact through video, no this series will most likely never be based on &amp;ldquo;video&amp;rdquo;. There shall be nothing but plain text to read. So I hope you like reading!
Before we get into this, I want to give you a quick disclaimer that I am no C# professional and I am only really just going to teach you everything that I know.</description>
